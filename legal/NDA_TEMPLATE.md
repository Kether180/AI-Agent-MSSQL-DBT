## NOTES FOR USE

1. **Mutual vs One-Way:** This is a mutual NDA (both parties share info). If only you're sharing, use a one-way NDA.

2. **When to Use:**
   - Before sharing code, architecture, or business plans
   - Before technical discussions or demos
   - Before hiring contractors or employees
   - Before pitching to investors (though some VCs refuse to sign)

3. **Limitations:**
   - NDAs don't prevent someone from building a competing product using their own knowledge
   - Hard to enforce if someone "happens" to build something similar later
   - Won't stop a determined bad actor

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Sign BEFORE sharing anything confidential
   - Keep detailed records of what was disclosed and when
   - Mark documents as "Confidential"
   - Use watermarking or document tracking when possible

5. **Legal Review:**
   - Have a lawyer review for your jurisdiction
   - Some states (like California) have restrictions on non-compete provisions
   - International NDAs may need additional provisions
