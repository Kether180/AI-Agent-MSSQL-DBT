## 2. EQUITY OWNERSHIP

### Initial Equity Split:

**Option A: Equal Split (50/50)**
- Alexander Garcia Angus: 50% ownership
- [Co-Founder Name]: 50% ownership

**Option B: Founder-Weighted (Recommended for your case)**
- Alexander Garcia Angus: 60% ownership (CEO/CTO + ML expertise + existing IP)
- [Co-Founder Name]: 40% ownership (Engineering + Sales)

**Option C: Work-Based (If co-founder is joining later)**
- Alexander Garcia Angus: 70% ownership (6+ months of prior work)
- [Co-Founder Name]: 30% ownership (joining now)

**Recommended for DataMigrate AI: Option B (60/40)**

**Reasoning:**
- You built the initial prototype and own the IP
- You have specialized ML/AI expertise
- You're taking on CEO responsibilities
- Co-founder brings critical engineering and sales skills
- 60/40 is fair and keeps co-founder motivated

### Vesting Schedule:

All equity shall vest according to the following schedule:

**Standard 4-Year Vest with 1-Year Cliff:**
- **Cliff:** 25% vests after 1 year of continuous service
- **Monthly Vesting:** Remaining 75% vests monthly over next 3 years (1/48 per month)
- **No Acceleration:** No equity vests before the cliff date

**Example for 60% ownership:**
```
Month 0: 0% vested (nothing)
Month 12: 15% vested (25% of 60% = cliff)
Month 13: 16.25% vested (15% + 1.25% monthly)
Month 24: 30% vested (50% through vesting)
Month 36: 45% vested (75% through vesting)
Month 48: 60% vested (100% - fully vested)
```

**Why Vesting Matters:**
- Protects you if co-founder leaves early
- Standard in startup world
- Required by investors
