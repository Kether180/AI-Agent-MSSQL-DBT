## Final Advice

> "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." - John Johnson

Start with **Clean Code**. It's the most important book on this list. Read it slowly, apply what you learn to your projects, and you'll see immediate improvements in your code quality.

The books are ordered by importance, not difficulty. Start with the most important ones first, even if they're challenging. You can always come back to them later with more experience.

**Happy learning!** 📚🚀
