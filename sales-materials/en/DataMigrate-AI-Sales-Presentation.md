# DataMigrate AI
## Transform Your Legacy Data Infrastructure with AI-Powered Migration

# The Problem

### Legacy Database Migration is Painful

- **Time-Consuming**: Manual SQL Server migrations take weeks or months
- **Error-Prone**: Human errors in data transformation cause costly mistakes
- **Resource-Intensive**: Requires specialized DBAs and data engineers
- **Undocumented**: Legacy systems often lack proper documentation
- **Testing Gaps**: Manual testing misses edge cases and data quality issues

### The Cost of Doing Nothing

- Outdated infrastructure limits business agility
- Rising maintenance costs for legacy systems
- Inability to leverage modern analytics and AI
- Compliance risks with untracked data lineage
